## Description

A command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. My goal while creating this project was to better learn how to leverage inquirer and mySQL in one application. 

I used this application to learn how to used SQL relations and keys to link department, roles, and employees.

On a mysql terminal, use the source <path> command to create schema locally and once again to seed the table. In index.js change password to your own SQL password.

## Usage
Start this application in the CLI using "npm start". The application will launch a menu for employee tracking. Options include adding a role, department, or employee and viewing all roles, departments, or employees in order of their IDs. Employees roles can also be updated.
